    "In the following, we want to develop a program to test positive integer numbers for the prime property. A positive integer larger than 1 is a prime if it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The student Lydia Leibnitz proposes the following algorithm for the task:\n",
    "1. We are given a natural number $n$ that we want to test\n",
    "2. In a loop, we test whether `n % m == 0` for all natural numbers $m$ with $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "3. If the test (2) is `True` for any of the tested $m$, then $n$ is not prime. Otherwise, we have a prime number.\n",

    "Divisors of $n$ come in pairs and say $n = ab$. Then **exactly one** of the two follwing possibilities can be true:\n",
    "1. $a < \\sqrt{n} \\text{ and } b > \\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "2. $a > \\sqrt{n} \\text{ and } b < \\sqrt{n}$\n",

    "To see this, we assume $a< \\sqrt{n} \\text{ and } b < \\sqrt{n}$. Then follows $n = ab < \\sqrt{n}\\sqrt{n} < n$ which leads to the contradiction $n<n$! Similarily, we conclude that not both, $a$ and $b$ can be larger than $\\sqrt{n}$. It follows that one of the divisors of $n$ must be smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ and we only need to test $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$ to check whether $n$ is a prime.\n",

    "Your tasks:\n",
    "1. Implement Lydias algorithm to test a given number $n$ for the prime property. Your program should report with a text-message, which number is tested and whether it is a prime or not.\n",
    "2. Test your program with the numbers 8, 105, 177, 51, 5, 47, 199 and 967. Your program should report the last four numbers as primes and the others as non-prime.\n",

    "## Chicken McNuggets\n",
    "Mc Donalds sells its Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 and 20 pieces. Write a ```python``` program which tests for a given number `N` whether `N` nuggets can be bought or not. Your program should print *all* possible package combinations in which the `N` nuggets can be obtained (e.g. 60 nuggets can be bought with 3 packages of 20 pieces, 10 packages of 6 pieces and three more combinations). Print a corresponding message if the `N` nuggets cannot be bought! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- This is a *brute force* problem. It means that you need to find the solutions by trying *all possibilities*. One possible approach is as follows: Write three nested `while` loops iterating over the variables `m`, `n` and `o`. The variables represent the number of packages with corresponding pieces. `m` stands for the number of packages with 6 nuggets and so on. Within the innermost loop, you can check with an `if`-statement such as\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (6 * m + 9 * n + 20 * o) == N:\n",
    "    print('possible solution found ....')\n",
    "```\n",
    "whether your current combination of `(m, n, o)` is a solution to the problem. You now only need to find iteration limits for `m`, `n` and `o` to solve the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For `N=60`, you should find the following solutions for `(m * 6, n * 9, o * 20)`: `(0, 0, 3)`, `(1, 6, 0)`, `(4, 4, 0)`, `(7, 2, 0)`, `(10, 0, 0)`."
